# Embedded System Project

Our project for the Special Topic: Embedded Programming class.

## Setup

This project was created using the Arduino IDE.
It is intended to run on an Arduino UNO R3 that has an ATmega328P microcontroller.
The robot kit we received is similar to: <https://www.ebay.com/itm/203860722314>.

## Libraries

This project depends on:

- [Servo](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Servo) 1.2.1
- [IRremote](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/irremote/) 4.2.0

## Demo

We recorded two videos of our rover (poorly) navigating the course:
